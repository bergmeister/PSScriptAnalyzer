# UseCompatibleCommands

**Severity Level: Warning**

## Description

This rule identifies commands that are not available on a targeted PowerShell platform.

A PowerShell platform is identified by a name in the following format:

```
<os-name>_<os-arch>_<os-version>_<ps-version>_<ps-arch>_<dotnet-version>_<dotnet-edition>
```

Where:

- `<os-name>`: The name of the operating system PowerShell is running on.
    On Windows, this includes the SKU number.
    On Linux, this is the name of the distribution.
- `<os-arch>`: The machine architecture the operating system is running on (this is usually `x64`).
- `<os-version>`: The self-reported version of the operating system (on Linux, this is the distribution version).
- `<ps-version>`: The PowerShell version (from `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`).
- `<ps-arch>`: The machine architecture of the PowerShell process.
- `<dotnet-version>`: The reported version of the .NET runtime PowerShell is running on (from `System.Environment.Version`).
- `<dotnet-edition>`: The .NET runtime flavor PowerShell is running on (currently `framework` or `core`).

For example:

- `win-4_x64_10.0.18312.0_5.1.18312.1000_x64_4.0.30319.42000_framework` is PowerShell 5.1 running on Windows 10 Enterprise (build 18312) for x64.
- `win-4_x64_10.0.18312.0_6.1.2_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core` is PowerShell 6.1.2 running on the same operating system.
- `ubuntu_x64_18.04_6.2.0_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core` is PowerShell 6.2.0 running on Ubuntu 18.04.

Platforms come bundled with PSScriptAnalyzer as JSON files, named in this way for targeting in your configuration.
However, you can also generate your own platform profile using the CrossCompatibility module.

The compatibility profile setting takes a list of platforms to target.
A platform can be specified as:

- A platform name (like `ubuntu_x64_18.04_6.1.1_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core`), which will have `.json` added to the end
  and is searched for in the default profile directory.
- A file name (like `my_custom_platform.json`), which will be searched for the in the default profile directory.
- An absolute path to a file (like `D:\PowerShellProfiles\TargetMachine.json`).

The default profile directory is under the PSScriptAnalzyer module at `$PSScriptRoot/CrossCompatibility/profiles`
(where `$PSScriptRoot` here refers to the directory containing `PSScriptAnalyzer.psd1`).

An example configuration might look like:

```PowerShell
@{
    Rules = @{
        UseCompatibleCommmands = @{
            Enabled = $true
            TargetProfilePaths = @(
                'ubuntu_x64_18.04_6.1.2_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core'
                'win-4_x64_10.0.18312.0_6.1.1_x64_4.0.30319.42000_framework'
                'MyProfile'
                'another_custom_profile_in_the_profiles_directory.json'
                'D:\My Profiles\profile1.json'
            )
        }
    }
}
```
